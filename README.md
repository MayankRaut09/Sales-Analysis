# Sales Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive sales analysis project, which includes a Power BI dashboard and a Jupyter Notebook with data modeling and analysis.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze sales data and provide insights to improve business decisions. The project is divided into two main components:
1. A Power BI dashboard for interactive data visualization.
2. A Jupyter Notebook for data modeling and detailed analysis.

## Files in the Repository

- `Power BI project Dashboard.pbix`: This file contains the Power BI dashboard. It provides various interactive visualizations, including sales trends, geographical analysis, product performance, and more.
- `Sales_Model.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook includes the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard offers the following features:
- **Sales Overview**: Visual representation of total sales, sales growth, and key metrics.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Sales distribution across different regions.
- **Product Performance**: Analysis of sales by product categories and individual products.
- **Customer Insights**: Understanding customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

## Jupyter Notebook Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook includes:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Importing the sales data and performing necessary cleaning operations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis of the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve the predictive models.
- **Model Development**: Building and evaluating different machine learning models to predict sales and other relevant metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Open the `Power BI project Dashboard.pbix` file with Power BI Desktop.
   - Interact with the visualizations to explore different aspects of the sales data.

2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the `Sales_Model.ipynb` file with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and models.
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.

## Requirements

- **Power BI Desktop**: To view and interact with the Power BI dashboard.
- **Python and Jupyter Notebook**: To run the Jupyter Notebook analysis.
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data through interactive visualizations and detailed data analysis. The insights derived from this project can help businesses make informed decisions to drive growth and improve performance.
